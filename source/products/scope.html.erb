        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="large">Scope enables you to tap into the diverse cultures and mindsets that drive behavior; whether for employee-centric or consumer-driven purposes. Knowing what words to use, which stereotypes to avoid and what your target group responds best to - all elements critical to getting it right the first time. Your workplace diversity is a ready and reliable data source for that information.</p>
        <p class="large">Scope lets you survey your employee diversity base for both quantitative and qualitative data, giving you an instant snapshot of a diverse market segment and a fresh diversity benchmark each time out  â€“  one which traditionally took much longer, yielded aging data and cost a small fortune.</p>
